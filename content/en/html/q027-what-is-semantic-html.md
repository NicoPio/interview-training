# What is Semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup to reinforce the meaning of content on web pages, rather than merely defining its appearance. Semantic HTML uses HTML tags that carry meaning about the content they contain.

**Benefits of Semantic HTML:**

1. **Accessibility**: Screen readers and assistive technologies can better understand the content structure
2. **SEO**: Search engines can better understand the content hierarchy and importance
3. **Maintainability**: Code is easier to read and understand for developers
4. **Consistency**: Provides a standard way to structure content

**Examples of Semantic Elements:**

```html
<!-- Instead of using divs for everything -->
<div class="header">...</div>
<div class="navigation">...</div>
<div class="article">...</div>

<!-- Use semantic elements -->
<header>...</header>
<nav>...</nav>
<article>...</article>
<section>...</section>
<footer>...</footer>
```

Common semantic HTML5 elements include:

- `<header>` - Introductory content
- `<nav>` - Navigation links
- `<main>` - Main content
- `<article>` - Self-contained content
- `<section>` - Thematic grouping
- `<aside>` - Sidebar content
- `<footer>` - Footer content
- `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` - Images with captions
