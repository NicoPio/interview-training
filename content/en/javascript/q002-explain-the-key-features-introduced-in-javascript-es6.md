# Explain the key features introduced in JavaScript ES6

In ES6, JavaScript introduced these key features:

1. **Arrow Functions**: Concise syntax for anonymous functions with lexical scoping.
2. **Template Literals**: Enables multiline strings and variable inclusion for improved readability.
3. **Destructuring Assignment**: Simplifies extraction of values from arrays or objects.
4. **Enhanced Object Literals**: Introduces shorthand notation for defining object methods and dynamic property names.
5. **Promises**: Streamlines asynchronous programming with a cleaner, structured approach.
