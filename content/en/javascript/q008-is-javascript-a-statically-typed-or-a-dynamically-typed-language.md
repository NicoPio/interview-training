# Is JavaScript a statically typed or a dynamically typed language?

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. In a dynamically typed language, variable types are determined at runtime, allowing a variable to hold values of any type without explicit type declarations. This flexibility can make coding more convenient but may also lead to runtime errors if types are not handled appropriately.

JavaScript, being dynamically typed, allows variables to change types during execution and accommodates a wide range of data types without explicit type annotations.
