# What is DOM?

DOM stands for Document Object Model, serving as a programming interface for web documents.

1. **Tree Structure:** It represents the document as a tree, with the document object at the top and elements, attributes, and text forming the branches.
2. **Objects:** Every document component (element, attribute, text) is an object in the DOM, allowing dynamic manipulation through programming languages like JavaScript.
3. **Dynamic Interaction:** Enables real-time updates and interactions on web pages by modifying content and structure in response to user actions.
4. **Programming Interface:** Provides a standardized way to interact with a web document, accessible and modifiable using scripts.
5. **Cross-platform and Language-Agnostic:** Not bound to a specific language and works across various web browsers, ensuring a consistent approach to document manipulation.
6. **Browser Implementation:** While browsers have their own DOM implementations, they follow standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), ensuring uniformity in document representation and manipulation.
