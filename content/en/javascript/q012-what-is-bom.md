# What is BOM?



BOM (Browser Object Model) is a programming interface extending beyond DOM, providing control over browser-related features.

1. **Window Object:** Core BOM element representing the browser window, with properties and methods for browser control.
2. **Navigator, Location, History, Screen Objects:** Components handling browser information, URL navigation, session history, and screen details.
3. **Document Object:** Accessible through BOM, allowing interaction with the structure of web pages.
4. **Timers:** Functions like setTimeout and setInterval for scheduling code execution.
5. **Client Object:** Represents user device information, aiding in responsive web design.
6. **Event Object:** Manages events triggered by user actions or browser events.
